I started this project to help a friend of mine develop a website for a restaurant, at the begining i thought that using react native expo was the best option, since expo have a web mode built in it.
With the project progress i noticed some dificulties translating the mobile layout to the web layout, but this didn't bother me at first, with more time passed and more dificulties showing up i realized that this was not the way to go.

Im curently stoping this development path, Im switching to a react website with PWA capabilities
